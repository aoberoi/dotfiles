## Credentials

[Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) is a cross-platform credential manager
which supports many popular git-based source code hosts (e.g. GitHub). The install script in the parent directory
handles installing this credential manager.

The first time you push to a host like GitHub, you will be asked to log in.
