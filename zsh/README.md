## zsh configuration

### Order, conditions, and defaults

When a shell is opened:

1. `/etc/zshenv` - Does not exist on macOS systems.
2. `~/.zshenv` - Does not exist in default user home.
3. `/etc/zprofile` - **Login shells only** Calls `path_helper` to populate and reorder `$PATH`.
4. `~/.zprofile` - **Login shells only** Does not exist in default user home. Homebrew inserts startup script here by
  default, prepending the `$PATH` with its prefix.
5. `/etc/zshrc` - **Interactive shells only** macOS default settings for command history, keyboard bindings, prompt,
  Terminal.app integration
6. `~/.zshrc` - **Interactive shells only** Does not exist in default user home.
7. `/etc/zlogin` - **Login shells only** Does not exist on macOS systems.
8. `~/.zlogin` - **Login shells only** Does not exist in default user home.

When a shell is closed:

1. `~/.zlogout` - **Login shells only** Does not exist in default user home.
2. `/etc/zlogout` - **Login shells only** Does not exist on macOS systems.

### Interactive and login shells

A **login shell** is simply a shell, whether local or remote, that allows a user to authenticate to the system. These
shells are typically interactive shells.

An **interactive shell**, can accept input typed from the keyboard. Non-interactive shells are typically scripts,
including those that are called by `launchd`.

Terminal initially opens a both **login and interactive shell** (despite not putting in a username and password). But if
you run `zsh` inside an existing shell, that is **not a login shell** but it is an interactive shell.

SSH sessions are both **login and interactive shells**.

### Guidelines for each file

* `~/.zshenv` - Set environment for scripts. This should be used sparingly.
* `~/.zprofile` - Set environment for login shells. Good place to set `$PATH` and other things that don't assume
  interactivity.
* `~/.zshrc` - Set environment for interactive shells. Good place to set `$PROMPT`, aliases, completions, colors, and
  other things that are based on interactivity. `setopt` and `unsetopt` are typically in this file.
* `~/.zlogin` - Don't need this. Just use `~/.zprofile`.
* `~/.zlogout` - Release any resources obtained in `~/.zprofile`. Could be used to reset a terminal window title.

### Plugin management

This repo uses [antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/) to manage zsh plugins. It's quite an active and helpful
project, and doesn't cost too much on performance.

### Quick look at antidote performance

I ran [zsh-bench](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-bench#usage) on two barebones configurations, accomplishing the same
thing. Both configurations use one plugin (the pure prompt) The first does not have antidote and the second does have
antidote. This helps me judge how much time it costs to use antidote. Bottom line: its not perceptible.

</table>

### Completion system

When new completion functions are added, its often necessary to clear the cache before those completions will work:

```
$ rm ~/.cache/zsh/compdump
```

In addition, a custom symlink `~/.zfunc` is created and prepended to the zsh fpath. That symlink points to `zfunc` in
this directory. It contains scripts for completions (named with an underscore and then the command name). Any custom
completions or completions that are not placed in the Homebrew completions directory can be stored here.
