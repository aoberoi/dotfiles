        cat << EOF
Usage: sizeup <path>
Display both the apparent size and size on disk of a file or directory.

Options:
    -h, --help    Show this help message

The apparent size shows the logical size of the file or directory contents
(the full, uncompressed size of the data).
The size on disk shows how much physical disk space is actually being used,
which is typically what you want when investigating disk space usage. This
may be smaller than the apparent size due to filesystem compression, sparse
files, or other storage optimizations.

Examples:
    sizeup /path/to/file
    sizeup /path/to/directory
    sizeup -h
EOF
    }

    # Check for help flags or missing arguments
    if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] || [[ "$1" == "--help" ]] || [[ "$1" == "-h" ]]; then
        show_help
        return 1
    fi

    local target_path="$1"

    # Check if the path exists
    if [[ ! -e "$target_path" ]]; then
        echo "Error: '$target_path' does not exist"
        return 1
    fi

    # Get size on disk (actual allocated space, may be smaller due to optimizations)
    local disk_size=$(du -sh "$target_path" | cut -f1)
    echo "Size on disk:     $disk_size"

    # Get apparent size (uncompressed/logical size)
    local apparent_size=$(du -shA "$target_path" | cut -f1)
    echo "Apparent size:    $apparent_size"
